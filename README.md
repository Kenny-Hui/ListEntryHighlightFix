# List Entry Highlight Fix
Fix potential misalignment of list entry border in Minecraft.  
Available for Fabric 1.19 - 1.20.

## What?
Consider the following:  
<img alt="Minecraft Multiplayer screen with a server/row selected" src="assets/1.png">

Now look at the selected row:
<img alt="The selected row from the multiplayer screen zoomed in" src="assets/2.png">

Do you see it?

<img alt="Further zoomed in to the edge of the row, with the server icon inside a border" src="assets/3.png">
<br>
<img alt="The left margin between the border and the icon is 4px, while it's only 2px vertically" src="assets/4.png">

Now that you can't un-see it, this mod fixes that:

<img alt="It is now always aligned to 2px, all edge has the same margin" src="assets/5.png">

So it always aligns neatly ^w^
